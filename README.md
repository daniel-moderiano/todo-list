# Todo List

A simple, straightforward Todo list application. Supports due dates, priorities, and custom lists.

## About the project

This Todo list aims to provide basic todo functionality in a professional, responsive design. Users are able to perform general CRUD operations across multiple custom lists, and todos are saved via `localStorage`.

### Technologies used
This is a vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript project, and a purely frontend application. Part of the challenge of this application was finding a good design for desktop and mobile, and achieving all of the functionality required with vanilla JS/TS. Overall tech stack:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* TypeScript
* Webpack

## Future directions

An optional future challenge for this project will be to convert it to a full-stack application using (most likely) Firebase as a BaaS.
